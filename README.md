# a simple react exercise record

This project is a simple reproduction of the [jianshu](https://www.jianshu.com/) by react.

I have to mention that this project is more about learning the use of React than a pixel level perfect fork, so the GUI interface will be quite different from the official interface.

In this project, I used the following dependence:

[axios](https://github.com/axios/axios): for ajax to get the mock.json
[loadable](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/react-loadable): for lazy-loading
[react](https://github.com/facebook/react): as the main framework
[redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux): as a state management tool to store data
[react-redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux): for connecting the react and the redux
[react-transition-group](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group): as tool to make some animation
[styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components): a library for css in js

Maybe someone will ask me why I don't use redux/toolkit. Because I did this project for practice, at that time I was just getting into react and wasn't very good at looking up official documentation.
